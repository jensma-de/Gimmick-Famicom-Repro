# Gimmick Repro PCB for Famicom

This project provides all necessary files to create a custom reproduction PCB for the Famicom game "Gimmick!".

**the PCB thickness must be 1.2mm** to ensure compatibility with Famicom cartridges and hardware. Having it chamfered is even better for your cartridge slot, but not necessary.

### Features
- **Logo Option**: The Gerber files include two versions:
  - **With Gimmick! Logo** on the back side of the PCB.
  - **Without Logo** for a clean design.

### License

This project is **free to use and remix** for personal or educational purposes. If you modify and manufacture the PCB, please include my URL (jensma.de) somewhere on the board as attribution. This helps acknowledge the original project and keeps the community connected.

Happy building!
